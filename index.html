	<h2> <i> MY INTRODUCTION </i> </h2>
        <p> Hello!

           I am Monisha Ramesh from the <b> Business and Information Science Department </b>. I have an undergrad degree in Information Science Engineering which allowed me to gain interest in this domain and learn about languages like Java, C, C++, SQL and more. I am looking forward to broaden my business and technical knowledge in my masters. Apart from this I enjoy swimming, travelling and socializing. Looking forward to a great experience.
